# Creating a GitHub Account
Head over to [https://github.com/join](https://github.com/join) to create a new account on GitHub.

Even if you plan to use GitHub for an organization or company, you still need a personal account. You can create your organization or company later.

Enter a username, email address, and password, then click __Create an account__.

GitHub will send you a verification email. Follow the steps in that email to complete verification.

GitHub will ask you to customize your plan and tailor your experience, but these steps are optional. Complete them if you'd like, or move to the step step.
